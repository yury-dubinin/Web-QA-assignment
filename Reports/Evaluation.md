As a feature under test I selected first one from available ones on the list.
This feature represents major functionality that is an enabler for everything else. 
Without articles users cannot comment, tag or follow them.

Additionally, CRUD operations testing allowed me to demonstrate possible ways of automation.
I have selected using `Page Object Pattern` approach implemented in plain JavaScript. 

But manual test cases are written using `Gherkin` language and can be easily automated with Cucumber.

Readme, test-cases and bug report are having comments where necessary.

Application is in MVP stage with only major functionality working. Some data is missing after article is created and some duplicating buttons are displayed.
Like and follow actions are not persisted, but I did not create bug reports as this is hypothetical exercise.
