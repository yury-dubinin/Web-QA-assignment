# Web QA Assignment

## Description
This assessment’s goal is to measure the candidate's knowledge with test cases creation, test reporting and the ability to adapt with automation tools.

## Application Under Test
https://angular.realworld.io/

General functionality
- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles

## Deliverables
To start, please access the following web page https://angular.realworld.io/.
Based on the previously mentioned general functionality, the following is required:
1. Create a series of manual test cases that cover one functionality of your choice. Make sure that you give detailed instructions for each test case (step preconditions, steps to execute test case, expected results, etc). You can use any format you prefer.
2. UI Automate at-least 5 (the more, the better) of the previously created test cases, preferably using a Java/Kotlin framework.
Write documentation on how to run tests with the chosen tool.
3. Provide a test report for executed test cases (manual and automated)
4. In the case of finding bugs, provide a separate bug report
5. Provide an overall evaluation test report for the application (issues, risks, recommendation, etc.). Make it personal! Explain why you decided to automate what you’ve automated, why you decided to test what you’ve tested, what test strategies you decided to use and why.


All manual deliverables should be added to a "Reports" folder in root of project.

Once you are done, push your test assignment to your fork. Share a link to your repo when you are done with the assignment.



**NOTE:
If you need to take any assumptions please note them as part of your answers.**
